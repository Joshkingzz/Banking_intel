 📊 Bank Transaction Data Analysis Project

Welcome to the **Bank Transaction Data Analysis** repository. This project showcases a full-stack data analytics pipeline from **data cleaning** to **database querying**, and finally to **interactive dashboard reporting** combining the power of **SQL**, **Python**, and **Power BI**.

## 🔍 Project Overview

This project investigates customer transactions and behavior using a **normalized relational database**. The dataset includes dimensions such as customer segments, transaction types, currencies, branches, and channels.

The goal was to uncover insights across several business areas:

* **Customer segmentation**
* **Transaction behavior analysis**
* **Revenue and cost insights**
* **Trend and performance analysis**
